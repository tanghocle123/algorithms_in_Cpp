# algorithms_in_Cpp

  This project is made by me for purely fun and joy of helping other computer science students learning the book Algorithms in C++ by Robert Sedgewick.
  
  I know the exercises in the book can be hard, so I want to do as many exercise as I can so that it is easier for you to learn from my homework and have a new way of looking into things
  
  I do C++ primarily on C++11, I know it's very outdated, and I promise, if I finish this series and learn the new C++17 or even C++20, I will update all my code.
  
  Once again, thank you for reading this readme file. Hope you have a good day.
