1_2 

	List all the different ways to connect two different objects for the example in Figure 1_1

	We can connect it directly or indirectly, however we want.

	For example, in exercise 1_1

	0-2	0-2
	1-4	1-4
	2-5	2-5
	3-6	3-6
	0-4	0-4
	6-0	6-0
	1-3		1-4-0-6-3

	We can connect 1 and 3 as 1-3, not 1-4-0-6-3
	
	Or we can connect 0 and 5 as 0-5, not 0-2-5
