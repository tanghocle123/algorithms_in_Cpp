1_26

	Answer Exercise 1_25 for the case where we use an algorithm that requires N^3 instructions.

************************************************************************************************

	Old one complexity : A^3
	New one: (10A)^3/10 = 100*A^3 

	So the new one will be 100 time slower than the old one.
