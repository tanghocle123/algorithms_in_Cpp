1_22

	Modify Program 1_4 to generate random pairs of integers between 0 and N-1 instead of reading them from standard input, and to loop until N-1 union operations have been performed. Run your program for N=10^3, 10^4, 10^5, and 10^6 and print out the total number of edges generated for each value of N.
