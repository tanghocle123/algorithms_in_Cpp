	Describe a simple method for counting the number of sets remaining after using the union and find operations to solve the connectivity problem as describe in the text.

	Honestly I can't come up with a more clever solution for this exercise, so I will do this instead.

	int count = 0;
	int i=0;
	Traverse through the whole array, 
	- if arr[i]==0, it means that there exists a set (or more specifically, we have found the root of a set, there is only 1 root of a set, so we cannot miss-count it), count++;
	- And if arr[i]!=0, it means that that element in the array is not the root of a set, so it belongs to a set already, we might have miss-counted it, count++;
